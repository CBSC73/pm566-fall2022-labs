Table 1. Top 20 Words from All Abstracts

### *Table 1 shows the most common words amongst all the abstrcts in the dataset. The most common words are stop words like “the” and “of.” But on the top list is “COVID” and “19” as well as “cancer” and “prostate” so articles about COVID-19 are likely most common amongst the abstracts, followed by prostate cancer articles.*

### Step 2 - Tokenize the abstracts and count the number of each token after removing stop words

``` r
#Look at top tokens with Stop Words removed
top20nostop <-pubmedabs %>%
  unnest_tokens(word, abstract) %>%
  anti_join(stop_words, by = c("word")) %>%
  count(word, sort = TRUE)


top20nostop<- top20nostop[1:20,]

top20nostop %>%
    arrange(desc(n)) %>%
knitr::kable(caption = "Table 2. Top 20 Words from All Abstracts, Stop Words Removed", align=c("l", "c"))
```

| word         |  n   |
|:-------------|:----:|
| covid        | 7275 |
| 19           | 7080 |
| patients     | 4674 |
| cancer       | 3999 |
| prostate     | 3832 |
| disease      | 2574 |
| pre          | 2165 |
| eclampsia    | 2005 |
| preeclampsia | 1863 |

| clinical     | 1682 |
| risk         | 1588 |
| women        | 1327 |

| results      | 1281 |

| data         | 945  |
| health       | 922  |

Table 2. Top 20 Words from All Abstracts, Stop Words Removed

### *Table 2 shows the most common words among all the abstracts with stop words REMOVED. This DOES change what tokens appear as the most frequent, and now the results are more illuminating.Now the most common words are “COVID” and “19” with “cancer” and “prostate” coming next. Then “eclampsia” and “preeclampsia” with related words like “pregnancy” appear in the list now too, thus articles about pre-eclampsia are probably third most numerous after COVID and prostate cancer.*

``` r
pubmedabs %>%
  unnest_tokens(word, abstract) %>%
  anti_join(stop_words, by = c("word")) %>%
  count(word, sort = TRUE) %>% 
  top_n(20, n) %>%
  ggplot(aes(n, fct_reorder(word, n))) +
  geom_col()+
    labs(title="Figure 1. Top 20 Most Common Words for all abstracts, no Stop Words")
```

![](HW03_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-16-1.png)<!-- --> \### *Figure 1
gives a visual of the data from Table 2, showing the top 20 words in the
abstracts with NO stop words. We can see how dramatic the difference is
between COVID-19 related words versus words from other abstracts. There
are twice as many COVID related words than prostate cancer, and around
three times more than preeclampsia.*

### Step 3 - Examine Top 5 words BY search term after removing stop words

``` r
top5byterm <- 
    pubmedabs %>%
    group_by(term) %>% 
  unnest_tokens(word, abstract) %>%
  count(word, sort = TRUE) %>% 
  anti_join(stop_words, by = c("word")) 

top5byterm %>%
    top_n(5,n) %>%

Table 3. Top 5 Words by Search Term with Stop Words Removed

### *Table 3 shows the top 5 words from abstracts each of the five search terms. We can see that the top terms are very different depending on the original search term. We get more words that are more specific to that particular topic.*

## Section 2 - Tokenize the abstracts into bigrams. Find the 10 most common bigrams and visualize them with ggplot2.

``` r
pubmedabs %>%
  unnest_ngrams(bigram, abstract, n=2) %>%
  count(bigram, sort = TRUE) %>%
  top_n(10, n) %>%
  ggplot(aes(n, fct_reorder(bigram, n))) +
  geom_col()+
  labs(title="Figure 2. Top Ten Most Common Bigrams (Two Word Terms)")
```

### *Figure 2 shows the top ten most common bigrams (two word terms) in the abstracts. Covid-19 remains by far the most common abstract subject, followed by prostate cancer and then pre-eclampsia.*

### Section 3 - Calculate the TF-IDF value for each word-search term combination. What are the 5 tokens from each search term with the highest TF-IDF value? How are the results different from the answers you got in Question 1?

``` r
term_table <-pubmedabs %>%
  group_by(term) %>% 
  unnest_tokens(word, abstract) %>%
  count(word, sort = TRUE) %>%
    bind_tf_idf(word, term, n)



term_table %>%
    top_n(5,tf_idf) %>% 
    arrange(desc(term)) %>%
knitr::kable(digits =4, align=c("l", "c", "c", "c","c","c"), caption = "Table 4. Top 5 TF-IDFs by Search Term")

Table 4. Top 5 TF-IDFs by Search Term

### Table 4 shows the highest TF-IDF values for each of the five search terms. The TF-IDF value shows the most relevant terms for each of the abstract searches. It also corrects for the fact there are many more articles about COVID than than are for the other subjects so its possible to see which tokens are most important in each search.”

### *Comparing the information in this table to the top tokens from Question 1, this table shows much more interesting information because it speaks to what the articles are actually about for that search term. For instance, for cystic fibrosis abstracts “CFTR” comes up which is the gene that is abnormal in this condition. “Sweat” also comes up which is a clinical test for cystic fibrosis, thus many of the abstracts are probably focusing on genetic and clinical diagnostic tests for the condition. Prostate cancer is also really interesting because prostatectomy and castration now show up which are treatments to resect/cure the cancer so most likely there are a lot of abstracts about prostate cancer treatments in this dataset.*
